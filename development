			    <h1>Mobile Development</h1>
				<p class="dev_content">
				    Our team began building native mobile apps in 2009 and have extensive experience with iOS, Android and Hybrid app development. We design our apps using Sketch to bring designs to life before development even begins.
				</p>
				<p class="dev_content">
				    We cut our teeth building native mobile apps from scratch using native frameworks such as iOS Xcode (objective C), Android SDK (Java) and Windows SDKS. Since that time mobile has evolved and us along with it. While we retain those core skills of developing in native platforms we have refined our process to use single source tools such as Xamrin (https://www.xamarin.com/) and React (https://facebook.github.io/react-native/). We have also been apart of the amazing improvement in mobile web technology and build more elements in mobile web than any other. Mobile web frameworks such as angular.js, react.js and vue.js are core components in our technology stack. Frameworks such as Foundation and Bootstrap have played key roles in our ability to build amazing responsive sites with increadible speed.

			    <h1>Web Development</h1>
				<p class="dev_content">
				    We are masters of web development using HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript. We design web experiences "mobile first" because we understand most web traffic today comes from a mobile device. You'll be amazed at what mobile web can do! 
				</p>
				<p class="dev_content">
				    Web development tools change faster than any other area of software development and we stay very focused on every new tool, framework and methodology that emerges. This deep focus and experience in web development allows us to select the perfect development tools and frameworks to use for a given project. Not every web project is the same and our engineers are apart of the delivery process from the beginning so we can understand the requirements and user stories before selecting a tech stack. Selecting the right tech stack and 3rd parties tools is an essential part of our development process and we believe our ability to select the right tool for the right job is what gives us an increadible edge in delivering state of the art software with amazing speed and precision.
