			    <h1>Mobile Development</h1>
				<p class="dev_content">
				    Our team began building native mobile apps in 2009 and have extensive experience with iOS, Android and Hybrid app development. We design our apps using Sketch to bring designs to life before development even begins.
				</p>
				<p class="dev_content">
				    We cut our teeth building native mobile apps from scratch using native frameworks such as iOS Xcode (objective C), Android SDK (Java) and Windows SDKS. Since that time mobile has evolved and us along with it. While we retain those core skills of developing in native platforms we have refined our process to use single source tools such as Xamrin (https://www.xamarin.com/) and React (https://facebook.github.io/react-native/). We have also been apart of the amazing improvement in mobile web technology and build more elements in mobile web than any other. Mobile web frameworks such as angular.js, react.js and vue.js are core components in our technology stack. Frameworks such as Foundation and Bootstrap have played key roles in our ability to build amazing responsive sites with increadible speed.
